            <h2>Welcome to AI Baby Monitoring web-app!</h2>
            <h4>This web-app helps you to monitor your baby. It uses an object detection model called CoCoSSD, that
                aims to identify multiple objects in a single image, to identify your baby. You have to simply click
                the picture of the baby or upload it from your device and then leave it all to us. If the baby is not
                in the room or in any kind of danger (like using sharp objects, sitting near the window or etc.), you'll
                be notified and a loud alarm will be played to alert you. This web-app is very useful in case you urgently
                have to go somewhere or due to any reason you're not available for your baby.
                <br>
                So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and enjoy the fun journey of monitoring your baby! Kindly give feedback
                if you like my app and share it with your friends and family!
